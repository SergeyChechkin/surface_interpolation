# Surface Interpolation.
## [Work in progress]
This Surface Interpolation library is a set of template classes that provide computation of  closed-form surface representation for local point cloud patch. 
Used in surfel map generation, point cloud smoothing, point cloud normal generation.   

Currently implemented only second and third degree polynomial surface functions.
